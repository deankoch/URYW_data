## about us

We are a team of mathematicians, statisticians, and ecologists, conducting a multi-year research project to develop an operational forecasting system for streamflow and water quality on the [Upper Yellowstone River](http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/images/Storyimages/2017/UpperYellowstoneMap.jpg) (UYR) and its tributaries. Our system will be based on [SWAT+/gflow](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/7/4/75), a hybrid of the [SWAT+](https://swat.tamu.edu/software/plus/) (Soil-Water-Assessment Tool) model for surface water dynamics, and gflow, physically-based groundwater flow module developed by Ryan Bailey to replace the current SWAT+ aquifer module. 

## R code

The UYRW_data repository is a staging area for R code that can be used to fetch data on the hydrology of UYR. This repository will be active during the early stages of our project (August-November 2020), as we assemble datasets and build documentation for the model. The following scripts download the data:

* [get_basins](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_basins.md)
defines the study area and loads some hydrology info using
[`nhdplusTools`](https://usgs-r.github.io/nhdplusTools/)
* [get_weatherstations](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_weatherstations.md)
finds climatic sensor station data using
[`rnoaa`](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa)
* [get_dem](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_dem.md)
fetches the National Elevation Dataset from USGS using
[`FedData`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FedData/index.html)
* [get_streamgages](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_streamgages.md)
fetches sensor data from the USGS NWIS using
[`dataRetrieval`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html)
* [get_soils](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_soils.md)
fetches SSURGO/STATSGO2 data from the Soil Data Mart using
[`FedData`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FedData/index.html)
* [get_landuse](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_landuse.md)
fetches GAP/LANDFIRE data from the [USGS ScienceBase catalogue](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/)
* [get_meteo](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_meteo.md)
fetches three different gridded meteorological reconstructions of Northwestern North America
* [get_snow](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/get_snow.md)
fetches snow data from SNOTEL and partner networks

Given the DEM and the USGS gage data, we delineate regions within the UYRW that can be separately fitted
with a SWAT+: 

* [make_subwatersheds](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/make_subwatersheds.md)
partitions the UYRW area into subwatersheds with USGS gages at their outlets

In a [separate repository](https://gitlab.com/rob-yerc/swat), we are developing a python module that will
take the output of `make_subwatersheds.R` (and some configuration parameters) and run the QSWAT+ workflow
(in PyQGIS) automatically, similar to Celray James'
[SWAT+ Automatic Workflow (AW)](https://celray.github.io/docs/swatplus_aw/introduction.html), but customized
to our use case. An R package for interpreting and writing SWAT+ I/O files is also in development, and this
will include an R wrapper for calls to the python script, allowing users to build SWAT+ models automatically
from scratch, and then review/edit/calibrate them, all without leaving the R environment. A link to these tools
should appear soon on this page.

Our R data analysis workflow is structured around git and markdown. Our scripts (\*.R) are documented as dynamic reports -- markdown files of the form \*.knit.md. These document our code and methods in human-readable detail, with console output and figures incorporated automatically using [`rmarkdown` using roxygen2](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_report_from_r_script.html). See Jennifer Bryan's
[Am Stat article](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928) and [instructional pages](https://happygitwithr.com/) for more on this.

<!--- These scripts prepare the data structure needed to run the

python codebase from Celray James and Chris George. SWAT+ AW replaces the QSWAT+ GUI as the
main tool for setting up a SWAT+ watershed model, as part of an effort towards reproducible
catchment modelling science
(see also [this talk](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/iemssconference/2018/Stream-A/64/)). --->

## funding

Our work is funded through a [MITACS](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/about) [Accelerate International](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/accelerate/mitacs-accelerate-international) grant to Dean Koch, partnering the University of Alberta with R2CS LLC in Montana, and the [Yellowstone Ecological Research Center](https://www.yellowstoneresearch.org/yerc-lab). The project began on August 3, 2020.
