**demo\_rswat\_docs.R**: Access variable definition tables in the SWAT+
documentation PDF from R

This script demonstrates
[rswat\_docs.R](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/rswat_docs.md),
which reads and parses the SWAT+ inputs PDF
(“inputs\_swatplus\_rev60\_5.pdf”) into a large name/definition
dataframe, whose entries can then be searched or printed to the console.

## introduction

Users of the SWAT+ model may find the number of built-in process
submodels and associated parameters a bit overwhelming. There are a LOT
of variables to keep track of. The latest configuration file
documentation PDF (“inputs\_swatplus\_rev60\_5.pdf”, [available
here](https://swatplus.gitbook.io/docs/user/io)) runs over 250 pages\!
And that’s just input variable name definitions.

The code below demonstrates an indexing and search tool to help R-based
SWAT+ users like me navigate this document. The codebase render the PDF
into text strings, building a giant searchable list of all “Variable
Name”/“Definition” entries.

## what’s wrong with ctrl-f?

Yes, you could just search for keywords using your favorite PDF viewer,
except that:

  - abbreviations won’t turn up in literal keyword searches with viewers
    like Acrobat or Sumatra
  - variable names are often mentioned multiple times in the document
    before we get to their full definitions
  - many variable names are slightly different in SWAT+ versus SWAT2012
    (and the theory documentation was written for the latter)

By my count there are 1000+ variable names defined in this document - I
don’t think anyone is going to memorize them all. So when you know what
you’re looking for but can’t quite remember the exact name it can be a
real chore to track it down. `rswat_docs` provides a more direct search
tool that supports fuzzy matching of multiple keywords to both names and
definitions.

## libraries and installation

The easiest way to try this code out yourself is to simply download the
Rscript sourced below
([rswat\_docs.R](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/rswat_docs.md))
and install any missing packages on your machine.

``` r
# library `here` is not strictly necessary; I just use it to simplify paths
library(here)
source(here('R/rswat_docs.R'))
```

`rswat_docs.R` will initialize an environment called `.rswat` in your
session, and define four functions; `rswat_docs`, `rswat_pdf_open`,
`rswat_pdf_parse`, and `my_adist`.

## getting started

Users will need to download “inputs\_swatplus\_rev60\_5.pdf” from the
SWAT+ [I/O docs](https://swatplus.gitbook.io/docs/user/io) page and
change the PDF path variable below to point to their local copy.
`rswat_pdf_open` will then load and parse the PDF for you:

``` r
# set the PDF path
pdfpath = here('development/inputs_swatplus_rev60_5.pdf')

# load the file into memory
rswat_pdf_open(pdfpath, quiet=TRUE)
```

    ## [1] "D:/UYRW_data/development/inputs_swatplus_rev60_5.pdf"

This function call does a lot of stuff in the background - it uses the
`pdftools` package to render text boxes into character strings, then
loops over pages to parse table entries into a large dataframe.
Definitions spanning multiple lines get concatenated, and tables
spanning multiple pages get merged automatically.

Print a list of files in this database using `rswat_docs()`

``` r
# list available files (print only the first 25)
rswat_docs() %>% head(25)
```

    ##               file ndef npage startpage

``` r
rswat_docs() %>% nrow
```

    ## [1] 105

The parser finds 105 different name-definition tables in the document,
each associated with a different SWAT+ configuration file. The `ndef`
field counts the number of definitions for each table, `startpage`
indicates the page (in the PDF) on which this table starts, and `npage`
counts the number of pages a table runs for.

## accessing documentation from R

Let’s look at the example of the “snow.sno” file, which controls
snowfall/snowmelt processes:

``` r
rswat_docs() %>% filter(file=='snow.sno')
```

    ##       file ndef npage startpage
    ## 1 snow.sno   10     3       176

This starts on page 176 and runs for three pages. To view the full text
of one of these pages in R, simply pass a page number or a vector of
them:

``` r
# print a specific page of the PDF
rswat_docs(176)
```

    ## 
    ## ~~~ page 176 ~~~

    ##                                cfu/100mL. The value varies greatly for different types of
    ##                                septic systems (See Table A-1 of Siegrist et al., 2005).
    ##                                Required.

    ## SNOW.SNO
    ## The SNOW.SNO file contains the input variables for snow. Below is a partial listing of the snow.sno file.

    ##                           A default recommended for this variable is SFTMP = 1.0.
    ##                           Required in watersheds where snowfall is significant.

    ##                           temperature should be between –5 ºC and 5 ºC.
    ##                           A default recommended for this variable is SMTMP = 0.50.
    ##                           Required in watersheds where snowfall is significant.

We can see that this page contains the start of the snow parameters
table, and also the tail end of a previous table (“septic.sep”). The
“snow.sno” table runs for two more pages. View the entire table as a
dataframe by passing the associated filename to `rswat_docs`:

``` r
# load table for an example filename
rswat_docs('snow.sno')
```

Longer definitions are clipped (they end with ‘…’) so that they can fit
cleanly into an R console printout of a dataframe (similar to
`tibble::print.tbl`). To access the full definition, you can use the
`full=TRUE` argument

``` r
# if you like tibbles, use `full=TRUE` and pipe to `tibble`
rswat_docs('snow.sno', full=TRUE) %>% tibble %>% print
```

    ## 10 result(s) in file(s) snow.sno

Since R is printing the literal description strings, which often contain
newline characters, the output is full of “\\n”s, which causes the
description text to look messy. If we pipe these strings to `cat`, the
newlines will render correctly and show us the original text (more or
less) as it appeared in the PDF.

By default, `rswat_docs` does this automatically whenever a search query
yields a unique match. For example the following call selects the
“falltmp” variable from “snow.sno”. Since this the only match for
“falltmp”, the function prints its full description in addition to
returning the dataframe:

``` r
# demonstrate filename argument and single match behaviour
rswat_docs('falltmp', fname='snow.sno')
```

    ## 1 exact result(s) for "falltmp" in 1 file(s)
    ## 
    ## ~~~ snow.sno : falltmp ~~~
    ## Snowfall temperature (ºC).
    ## Mean air temperature at which precipitation is equally likely
    ## to be rain as snow/freezing rain. The snowfall temperature
    ## should be between –5 ºC and 5 ºC.
    ## A default recommended for this variable is SFTMP = 1.0.
    ## Required in watersheds where snowfall is significant.

    ##      name     file pstart                                                               description
    ## 1 falltmp snow.sno    176 Snowfall temperature (ºC). Mean air temperature at which precipitation...

In this case the first argument (`pattern`) is our search keyword, and
we have passed the filename in the second argument (`fname`).
`rswat_docs` will automatically detect when `pattern` is a filename and
return the full table of variables for the file as it did above, with
the exception of description-only queries (where `descw=1`); an example
of this can be found in the next section.

## searching for keywords

Some SWAT+ variable names are unique enough to turn up a single match in
searches. For example we can repeat the previous call without `fname`
and get the same unique result:

``` r
# demonstrate unique single match among all files
rswat_docs('falltmp')
```

    ## 1 exact result(s) for "falltmp" in 1 file(s)
    ## 
    ## ~~~ snow.sno : falltmp ~~~
    ## Snowfall temperature (ºC).
    ## Mean air temperature at which precipitation is equally likely
    ## to be rain as snow/freezing rain. The snowfall temperature
    ## should be between –5 ºC and 5 ºC.
    ## A default recommended for this variable is SFTMP = 1.0.
    ## Required in watersheds where snowfall is significant.

    ##      name     file pstart                                                               description
    ## 1 falltmp snow.sno    176 Snowfall temperature (ºC). Mean air temperature at which precipitation...

By default, when exact (substring) matches are found, `rswat_docs`
returns only them. If no exact matches are found, it returns approximate
matches. This can be pretty effective for tracking down variable names
when you have a rough idea of the name but you’re not sure about the
exact abbreviation in use.

For example we can find entries related to the Hargreaves-Samani PET
model like this:

``` r
# search for "Hargreaves" in descriptions and names
rswat_docs('Hargreaves')
```

    ## 3 exact result(s) for "Hargreaves" in 3 file(s)

    ##       name          file pstart                                                               description
    ## 1 harg_pet hydrology.hyd    126              Coefficient related to radiation used in Hargreaves equation
    ## 2     ipet   hru-lte.hru     88 Potential evapotranspiration (PET) method (character): ‘harg’ = Hargre...
    ## 3      pet     codes.bsn     18 Potential evapotranspiration (PET) method. There are four options for ...

Three parameters are matched (exactly) because the literal string
‘Hargreaves’ appears in their descriptions. By default `rswat_docs`
searches both names and descriptions, but this can be changed via
parameter `descw`. This is a number from 0 to 1 (inclusive) giving the
weight to assign to matches in descriptions (versus matches in names)
when ordering results.

For example with `descw=0` descriptions are ignored and only names are
searched:

``` r
# search names only
rswat_docs('Hargreaves', descw=0)
```

    ## No exact matches for "Hargreaves". Repeating search at fuzzy level 1 
    ## 1 approximate result(s) for "Hargreaves" in 1 file(s)
    ## 
    ## ~~~ hydrology.hyd : harg_pet ~~~
    ## Coefficient related to radiation used in Hargreaves equation

    ##       name          file pstart                                                  description
    ## 1 harg_pet hydrology.hyd    126 Coefficient related to radiation used in Hargreaves equation

In this case no exact matches are found so the function reverts to
approximate matching and finds a unique best result (“harg\_pet”, which
turned up first in the last search). This match is based on character
order and length. The other two results from before, “pet” and “ipet”,
have little in common with “Hargreaves” in that sense, so they are not
matched.

Description-only searching (`descw=1`) is useful for finding links
between tables:

``` r
# demonstrate description-only search 
rswat_docs('snow.sno', descw=1)
```

    ## 1 exact result(s) for "snow.sno" in 1 file(s)
    ## 
    ## ~~~ hru-data.hru : snow ~~~
    ## Snow database name (points to snow.sno)

    ##   name         file pstart                             description
    ## 1 snow hru-data.hru     86 Snow database name (points to snow.sno)

In this case `pattern` is a filename, but since `descw=1` it is
interpreted as a search query. So instead of returning the 10 variables
in the file “snow.sno” (as before), the function searches for the
keyword “snow.sno” in the description text, and it finds one exact
match. This match is to the description of variable“snow” from another
file, “hru-data.hru”, which provides a key for joining to the rows in
“snow.sno”

The default `descw=0.5` provides equal weight to descriptions and names.
This works well for matching broad keywords to variable names that may
or may not be an abbreviation of those keywords. For example a search
for “tile” turns up a number of variables related to tile drainage on
the basis of their descriptions

``` r
# demonstrate mixture of name and description matches
rswat_docs('tile')
```

    ## 9 exact result(s) for "tile" in 6 file(s)

    ##        name              file pstart                                                               description

## multiple keywords and fuzzy matching

Two of the results in the last call (from file “septic.sep”) were
matched only because of the word “tex**tile**” in their descriptions. To
avoid these kinds of false positives you can turn off substring matching
with `fuzzy=-1`

``` r
# example of exact (no substring) matching
rswat_docs('tile', fuzzy=-1)
```

The redundant results are gone but we are now missing the “cn” result
(in file “codes.bsn”), because it uses the term “tiled-drained”. If you
need to match more than one keyword in one search, you can separate
multiple words in `pattern` by a pipe:

``` r
# example of multiple keywords with OR operation
rswat_docs('tile|tiled', fuzzy=-1)
```

Pipes in `pattern` are interpreted as a logical OR operator. Similarly,
whitespace works like an approximate OR operator; whitespace-delimited
elements of `pattern` are searched separately, and their string
distances averaged to rank results:

``` r
# example of whitespace delimited keywords
rswat_docs('tile runoff ratio')
```

This works pretty well for identifying a small number of “best” matches
to a set of keywords. In this case we dropped the `fuzzy` argument, so
the function uses the default 0 (exact substring matching). If you want
more results, set `fuzzy` to have a value \>= 1:

``` r
# example of higher fuzziness level
rswat_docs('tile runoff ratio', fuzzy=1)
```

    ## 3 approximate result(s) for "tile runoff ratio" in 3 file(s)

    ##       name              file pstart                                                               description

One additional result is added to the list. With positive `fuzzy`, the
function ranks all approximate matches by their “distance” to the search
pattern, bins the results into groups of (nearly) equal rank, and
returns the first `ceiling(fuzzy)` groups.

More simply, this just means `fuzzy` controls the number of results
indirectly. Note that you may get more than one additional result by
setting `fuzzy=1`, and more than two with `fuzzy=2`, etc. To request a
fixed number of results, say `n`, simply set `fuzzy=Inf` to return
everything, and pipe the results to `head(n)`:

``` r
# example of setting a fixed number of results (10)
rswat_docs('tile runoff ratio', fuzzy=Inf) %>% head(10)
```

Here, `rswat_docs` returns a dataframe with all 1059 possible matches,
and `head(10)` extracts the top 10. The dataframe rows are ordered from
best to worst, so eg. the first three matches in this case are the same
as what we got with `fuzzy=1`

## thoughts and development plans

This is my first attempt at writing a text search tool, so it’s pretty
simple and ad-hoc in many ways. But I think it does the job well enough.
If you think it would be useful in your project, feel free to contact me
for help getting it to work on your machine. And if there’s any interest
in an R package based on this code, please let me know and I’ll start
tidying it up for CRAN.

In future it would be good to improve support for boolean queries and
maybe do some indexing on startup to make it snappier in `fuzzy=-1`
mode. I also plan to work on extensions that support the SWAT2012
documentation files.
