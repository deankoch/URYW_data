**rswat**: R functions for generating, reading, and editing SWAT+ files

## libraries

Required libraries are now specified in the categorized helper scripts
sourced below, with the exception of the `here` package, which is used
to located those files.

[`here`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/index.html)
simplifies paths involving a project working directory

``` r
library(here)
```

## helper functions

`rswat` is a set of helper functions for managing
[SWAT+](https://swat.tamu.edu/software/plus/) configuration files, and
related tasks. The codebase has gotten very large so it is split into
several files, each containing a number of helper functions definitions,
organized by task:

  - [`rswat_qgis`](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/rswat_qgis.md)
    runs QSWAT+ and SWAT+Editor to generate the SWAT+ project folder,
    and loads the QSWAT+ shapefiles

  - [`rswat_config`](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/rswat_config.md)
    manages model configuration files in the SWAT+ project folder

  - [`rswat_output`](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/rswat_output.md)
    assists with model execution and reading outputs. This depends on
    `rswat_config`

  - [`rswat_docs`](https://github.com/deankoch/UYRW_data/blob/master/markdown/rswat_docs.md)
    parses the I/O docs so they can be more easily searched (from R\!).
    This script can be sourced on its own (it doesnâ€™t depend on the
    others)

We wrote this code to learn/understand the model, get finer control over
its settings, and to develop our own customized extensions in our
implementation of SWAT+ on the Upper Yellowstone watershed. If there is
some interest from the SWAT+ community we will likely turn all of this
into an R package at some point.

``` r
# TODO: make this a package
# run the four helper scripts to define functions
source(here('R/rswat_qgis.R'))
source(here('R/rswat_config.R'))
source(here('R/rswat_output.R'))
source(here('R/rswat_docs.R'))
```
